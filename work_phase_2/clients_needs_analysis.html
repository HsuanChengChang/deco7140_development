                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI’s mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >celebrate and support the unique identities of

                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >represent and support different communities</span
                    >. Each website should serve as a central hub where
                    community members can share resources,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1"
                        >highlight events</span
                    >, and
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1"
                        >foster meaningful connections</span
                    >. The websites must not include any form of commercial
                    activity, such as advertising or selling products. However,
                    it is acceptable to promote resources, events, or services
                    that are directly beneficial to the community.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The websites must be
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3"
                        >accessible, mobile-friendly</span
                    >, and
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >reflect the diverse needs of the selected community
                        focus area</span
                    >
                    while adhering to our mission of
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >inclusivity</span
                    >,
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 3"
                        >accessibility</span
                    >, and
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 2"
                        >ethical design</span
                    >. Each website should also
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1"
                        >support meaningful interaction and engagement</span
                    >.
                </p>
