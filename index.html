            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently a student at the University of Queemsland.
            </p>
            <p>
                My prior professional experience as a conveyancer and a former Third Officer in maritime shipping 
                has developed my strengths in structured problem-solving, decision-making under pressure, 
                and working across disciplines. I now look forward to combining those strengths with technical skills 
                to solve real-world challenges in the digital age.
